Project Description

Based on the work that we've been doing in class, I used a variety of techniques
to create my project.

I used the random() function to generate different colours based on the HSB
(Hue, Saturation, Brightness) colour model.

I used the keyPressed() function to select a random colour based on the number
that's been selected.

I used the map() function so that whenever you move the mouse the number of tiles
in the X and Y axis increase or decrease.
