Project Description:

This project displays the data visually based on the location of my chosen place,
the white circles represent the amount of clouds in the area and the movement of
the clouds depends on the wind speed and type of clouds that is in the sky.

The data that I have extracted from the openweathermap.org website is: City
name, weather condition, average temperature, wind speed / ratio / degrees,
visibility and humidity.

Moreover, the data I have extracted is updated based on the last time that they
recently updated it.

I had attempted to add an input button so that I can change to a different location
rather than it being confined to just one location. Although I could extract
and look at the data through the console log, it didn't update the content on the
screen so I decided against implementing it into my code.

You can change the location manually by changing the city name in the 1st actual
line of code.
